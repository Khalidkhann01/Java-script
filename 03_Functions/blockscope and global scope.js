/// we should not declare variables by var because it comes out of the scope
///scopes are curly braces in the functions or conditions.
/// there are two types of scopes global and block
////the things inside the braces are block and outside the braces are global scopes
//// always declare variable by let or const(cannot be changed)
/// declaration of variable by var will make it difficult to debug becaue it will take value even outside the block
//// if we declare with let it will not come out of the block or effect the remaining coding
